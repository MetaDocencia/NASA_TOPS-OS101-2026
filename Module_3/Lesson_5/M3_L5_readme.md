## Overview

In this lesson, you will get some practice writing a data management plan (DMP) for your project. Having a DMP can clarify where, when, and how your data can be reused. You will also learn how to get involved in open data communities, opening up new avenues for sharing your data. Finally, you will learn about resources you can explore as well as training you can take to start your journey with open data.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- Describe the steps to take when writing a data management plan.
- List opportunities for involvement in the open data communities.
- Identify additional open science resources and list ways to continue training.

## Writing an Open Science and Data Management Plan

The process, responsibilities, and factors to consider when creating an Open Science and Data Management Plan have been presented throughout this module. Common elements of DMPs relevant to open data include a description of the following:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| What? | Data formats and (where relevant) standards |
| When? | When and if to share data |
| Where? | The intended repositories for archived data |
| How? | How the plan enables reuse of the data |
| Who? | Roles and responsibilities of the team members in implementing the DMP |

Two great places to start are [https://dmptool.org/](https://dmptool.org/) (external link) and [https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) (external link). You will need to create a free login to use these tools, but both websites walk researchers through the steps of writing a DMP. There are even some existing DMP templates stored within DMP Tool, such as the NASA Planetary Sciences Division's [DMP template](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/templates-planetary-science-division-appendix-c-roses-proposals/). There are also public examples of data management plans at [https://dmptool.org/public_plans](https://dmptool.org/public_plans) (external link) and [https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/public_plans) (external link).

If you are applying for funding, it is extremely likely that there will be specific requirements detailed in the funding opportunity. For example, the funder may require a certain license or use of a specific repository. Make sure to cross-reference your plan with these requirements!

### Activity 5.1: Review a data management plan

Take a look at the example of a public data management plan from the [ThEBES](https://dmptool.org/plans/30771/export.pdf?export%5Bquestion_headings%5D=true) (external link) project.

In the DMP, answer the following questions:

1. What: Data formats and (where relevant) standards.
2. When: When and if to share data.
3. Where: The intended repositories for archived data.
4. How: How the plan enables reuse of the data.
5. Who: Roles and responsibilities of the team members in implementing the DMP.

## Open Data Communities and You

### Getting Involved with Open Data Communities

There are numerous ways to get involved with and support open data communities, including starting your own community.

## Open Data Summary

Congratulations! Now that you have completed the module, you should be able to do the following:

- Explain what open data means, its benefits, and how FAIR principles are used.
- Discover open data, assess the data for reuse by evaluating provided documentation, and cite the data as instructed.
- Create an open data management plan, select open data formats, and add the needed documentation such as metadata, README files and version control to make the data reusable and findable.
- Evaluate whether your data should and can be shared, and use the data accessibility process (e.g. adding a DOI and citation instructions to enable it to be findable and citable).
