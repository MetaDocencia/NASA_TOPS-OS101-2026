## Overview

In the previous lessons, we learned about various ways to share our science and what steps we should think about when sharing. In this lesson, we tie the concepts from previous lessons together with specific guidance for writing the "Sharing Results" section of an Open Science and Data Management Plans (OSDMP). We will also reflect on how our society and technology constantly evolve, as does the way we do science. A new technology with the potential to radically alter the way we do and share science is artificial intelligence (AI), particularly when it comes to language learning models. These AI tools are already changing how we interact with written text. In this lesson, we will discuss some of the ways that AI has and will affect how we do and share our science.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you should be able to:

- List what to include in an OSDMP for sharing results openly.
- List some concrete steps toward sharing results openly.
- Describe how emerging technology like AI is currently impacting how we use, make, and share our science.

## Writing an OSDMP: What to Include in the OSDMP for Sharing Results Openly

The process within an Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP) to share data and code is covered in other modules, so here we will discuss how to share the other type of research outputs. Most proposals require that you include plans for publications such as peer-reviewed manuscripts, technical reports, books, and conference materials.

Though not required, it can be a good idea to include plans for making your results publicly accessible in ways other than traditional publishing (e.g. online blog posts, tutorials, or other materials). After all, writing an OSDMP is often required for funding requests, and this can be a way to show proposal reviewers that you are thinking about how to best share your science.

### Activity 5.1: Pen to Paper

Write a sample results section of an OSDMP that details how you would plan to make your results open. Think about an example from your research and what details you would need to include to convince reviewers that you will share open access results.

**Example 1:** This activity will result in two peer-reviewed publications that will be published green open access. Preprints will be archived in PubSpace.

**Example 2:** This activity will result in the creation of computational notebooks, four conference abstracts and posters, two peer-reviewed manuscripts, and two online plain-language articles summarizing our results. Peer-reviewed publications will be published Green Open-Access and preprints will be archived in PubSpace or the journal's open-access preprint server. All other materials will be archived on Zenodo, assigned a DOI, and assigned a CC-BY license or permissive software license.

For these examples, what other information or details could be added? If you were planning to write a tutorial about your science, what would you include?

When results and research products are published openly, anyone can reproduce the scientific result. Making research products easy to understand and the results transparent helps to reduce misinformation, increases public trust in results, and enables researchers at all levels to make use of available information.

Here is an example of open-source software and repositories available through GitHub. [Encode](https://github.com/brain-life/encode) (external link) is a software that can be used in neurocomputational analyses of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data to visualize anatomical structures and connectomes in the brain. This software, [described here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09250-w#Abs1) (external link), can be incredibly useful for mapping brain networks and understanding relations in human health and disease. The GitHub page also contains repositories for the necessary accompanying software as well as demo datasets for users to run while learning the code. This is a great example of how researchers can make science open and methods easy to follow such that research can continue smoothly.

There are lots of ways that open science can extend the span or scope of projects. Here are some steps you can take to share your open results in a way that makes your work more usable, reproducible, and collaborative:

- Add a Code of Conduct via the CODE_OF_CONDUCT file and link to other policies that apply to your work.
- Add contributors and authorship guidelines via a CONTRIBUTING file.
- Add your collaborators and team members' names with their permission.
- Add your funded proposal but remove any sensitive information.
- Create a preliminary roadmap and what goals the project is trying to achieve.
- Create a project management, code and data folders where you can upload appropriate information as your project develops.
- Create a resource list that your project requires.
- Provide links to training materials that your collaborators and contributors may benefit from.
- Use issues and project boards to communicate what is happening in the project.
- Use a pull request to invite reviews to new development of code and content.
- Add user manual and executable notebooks to allow code testing.
- Create and share executable notebooks that document how data is processed and the result obtained.
- Create tutorials or short form videos demonstrating how a step in your research workflow was accomplished.
- Write a blog post about your experience wrestling with a particular research challenge and how you solved it.
- Contribute to documentation to improve the open-source tools based on your own experience.
- Connect your repository to Binder to allow online testing of your code and executable notebooks.
- Link all the outputs that are generated outside this repository (like blog, video, forum post and podcast among others as discussed above).
- Some advanced steps that should be applied as the project develops include: continuous integration, containerization, Citation CFF file, and the creation of a simple web page to link all information.

## How Emerging Technology Like AI is Changing How We Do Science

Throughout these modules, the internet has been identified as a fundamental disruptive technology that changed how almost all of science is accomplished. Scientists rarely go to libraries to read the latest journal articles. Data is no longer mailed around the world on tape drives. Software isn’t shared via floppy disks. The internet helped create the modern scientific workflow and made science more interactive and accessible. Now AI tools are starting to disrupt science in a similar manner. AI is not only revolutionizing many aspects of our lives, it is also changing how we do science. As companies race to create and integrate new generative AI tools into every aspect of our lives, many scientists, institutions, journal publishers, and agencies are looking to see how to use these tools effectively; understand their reliability, accuracy, and biases; and how to also use these cutting edge tools ethically. An additional concern is how any information shared with AI tools may be used to intentionally or unintentionally disclose confidential data, leading to privacy concerns.

[IMG: PENDIENTE ]

AI can help us use and share research. It can act as an accelerant, taking care of tedious tasks while leaving scientists free for more creative thought. These tools are better than humans at processing vast amounts of data, but humans are better at creative and nuanced thought. This is important to consider when determining whether or not to use AI. As an example, many people already use AI tools to help with their inbox management and writing emails with AI-generated suggested content. Within science, there are many potential tasks that could potentially be expedited using AI, according to three studies published in Nature:

- [AI science search engines are exploding in number — are they any good?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01273-w) (external link)
- [How AI technology can tame the scientific literature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06617-5) (external link)

### Sharing with AI:

- Results - AI/ML models are increasingly being used in research. When sharing results, follow best practices as outlined in the ["Ethical and Responsible Use of AI/ML in the Earth, Space, and Environmental Sciences"](https://essopenarchive.org/users/536571/articles/635008-ethical-and-responsible-use-of-ai-ml-in-the-earth-space-and-environmental-sciences) (external link) article.
- Incremental prompting can help create an outline for your research article. An example can be found on [X](https://twitter.com/MushtaqBilalPhD/status/1640243808851075072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1640243808851075072%7Ctwgr%5E86f4269a3a6f05f7927bdb57e4f45654f827dc44%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.euronews.com%2Fnext%2F2023%2F08%2F07%2Fbest-ai-tools-academic-research-chatgpt-consensus-chatpdf-elicit-research-rabbit-scite). (external link) (formally known as Twitter).
- AI tools can help identify where to share results and help write social media or other short posts based on your article.

### Cautions About Use of AI Tools

Journals are increasingly implementing guidelines and requirements concerning the usage of AI tools during the writing process. Many require that the use of AI tools for writing, image creation, or other elements must be disclosed and their method of use identified. As is the case with all other material within an article, authors are fully responsible for ensuring that content is correct. Examples of this policy can be read in the AI guidelines of [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ai) (external link) and [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10318315/) (external link).

Furthermore, there are numerous examples of generative AI (for both code and content) delivering plagiarized information in violation of licenses, as well as fabricating material including citations. Using these AI tools may lead to findings of academic and research misconduct should fabrication, falsification or plagiarism be contained within AI generated materials. So be careful. Learn more about possible issues with AI in an [example from Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/artificial-intelligence-writing-tools-promise-faster-manuscripts-for-researchers) (external link).

At this time, and for these reasons, AI tools are generally not allowed in grant applications, peer-review, or proposal review activities.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has prohibited "scientific peer reviewers from using natural language processors, large language models, or other generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for analyzing and formulating peer review critiques for grant applications and R&D contract proposals." The NIH states that utilizing AI in the peer review process is a breach of confidentiality because these tools "have no guarantee of where data is being sent, saved, viewed or used in the future." Additionally, the NIH Notice states that using AI tools to help draft a critique or to assist with improving the grammar and syntax of a critique draft are both considered breaches of confidentiality. (National Institutes of Health, 2023)

AI tools for science are developing rapidly. The science community's understanding of how to ethically and safely use AI is just developing as its use in research expands rapidly. The guidelines above offer a snapshot in time and will likely continue to evolve. If you choose to use these tools for scientific research, carefully consider how much to rely on them and how their biases may impact results, as cautioned in [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02980-0)(external link). The internet has transformed the world and AI tools are likely to do the same. As with any tool, it is important they are used for the appropriate purpose and in an ethical manner.

## Open Results Summary

### Moving Toward an Open, Collaborative, and Transparent Scientific Future

Science is meant to benefit society. Sharing our science helps ensure that it benefits society and informs the decisions of the public and policymakers, especially when funded by public agencies or governments. Throughout this curriculum, we have focused on skills needed to make research products and processes available to all. The traditional practice of only sharing results limits insight into how science is done and may act to limit who can participate in science. By sharing your scientific process and working openly, you advance all of science in a more rapid and transparent way. This curriculum will continue to evolve as science evolves and we welcome your contributions!
